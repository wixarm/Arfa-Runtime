# arfa-runtime

Runtime package for the [Arfa JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-arfa) framework.  
It provides the core building blocks that Arfa apps need at runtime:

- **JSX pragma (`h`, `Fragment`)** for compiling JSX into VNodes
- **Renderer** for mounting and updating components
- **Router** with file-based routing, layouts, guards, and 404 handling
